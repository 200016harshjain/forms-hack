I currently feel forms (enterprise use cases) need an upgrade. Some issues I've noticed with forms
  - Most people don't care enough to fill the form. They just give one word respones - either the forms are designed poorly or they just have more important things to do.
  -  The few people who care enough to fill the form may get daunted by a blank screen - one can make this easier by having some sort of prompts
  -  Assuming people did fill the form - you may often have to reach out to individual responders to dive deeper into the responses

I think this can be solved using Generative AI. There are two broad approaches
  1) Have forms that "adapt" based on the responses of all the respondees. Demo link [here](https://www.loom.com/share/4605a96f193e46e3aa2ff3c6539e6a1a) 
  2) Have forms that "adapt" based on the responses of the single respondee


The code in this repo is frankly just some boilerplate frontend and an API call to OpenAI so the repo holds little value. However I think the working demo for (1) is pretty cool and can be carried forward

For (2), I found a lot cleaner demo [link](https://twitter.com/dhruvtrehan9/status/1713631214274585025)

Taking this from a demo to a product is a lot harder though
- approach (2) may lead to more detailed responses for a particular question but we may lose out on breadth of responses
- appraoch (1) can help seeding some possible responses to begin with but we may again start to feed words into our respondee's mouths.
